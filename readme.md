<h1 align="center">Discord Server Maker.</h1>

`Only setup bot I know of!`

### Personal-Statement:
Like with all my scripts, I coded this for my own education! Although I only recommend you to use my bot in your own server, because everything else is against discordâ€™s terms of service and could therefore ban you.

Insure yourself here: https://www.discord.com/terms

### Requirements:
- brain
- some python modules

### Setup:
- have python and pip installed
- download the current version of the bot
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- create discord server and bot (enable all intents!)
- make sure you are in the folders path
- run `main.py`

YouTube Instructions coming soon!
